Introduction
------------

  Multi-objective optimization problems are problems with several,
  typically conflicting criteria for evaluating solutions. Without any
  a priori preference information, the Pareto optimality principle
  establishes a partial order among solutions, and the output of the
  algorithm becomes a set of nondominated solutions rather than a
  single one.  Various ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have
  been proposed in recent years for solving such problems. These
  multi-objective ACO (MOACO) algorithms exhibit different design
  choices for dealing with the particularities of the multi-objective context.
  
  This program implements the multi-objective ant colony optimization
  (MOACO) framework. This framework is able to instantiate most MOACO
  algorithms from the literature, and also combine components that
  were never studied in the literature.

Building
------------

The programming language is C, and the software has been tested on
GNU/Linux using GCC >= 4.1.

The unpacked sources contain the following directories: btsp, libmisc,
libpareto, and moaco. Change the current directory to moaco/trunk and
invoke make:

   $ tar xvf moaco-0.1.tar.gz
   $ cd moaco/trunk
   $ make

For extending the code to a new problem, create a new directory
beside btsp, e.g., myproblem, and then implement all functions called
by the moaco and prefixed by Sol. The code can be compiled for the new
problem as:

   $ cd moaco/trunk
   $ make clean
   $ make PROBLEM=myproblem


------------
Usage
------------

An example of invocation is:

   $ cd moaco/trunk
   $ ~/bin/moaco_btsp --input ../../btsp/kroAB100.tsp --time 100 --BicriterionAnt

Other options available are given by the output of the parameter --help.

The instance type handled by the btsp follows the format produced by
the DIMACS benchmark generator [*]. Bi-objective TSP instances can be
constructed by simply concatenating two single-objective instances
such as:

   $ cat euclidA100.tsp euclidB100.tsp > euclidAB100.tsp
